# Face-and-Smile-Recognition using OpenCV

This repository consists of two python files. One is for face recognition by constructing a dataset , training the machine and recognizing the face.Other is for recognizing both face and smile through the live web cam.This project is done by using Python and OpenCV.

Face Recognition using OpenCV Python :

Once you try to implement the  face recognition model, create two folders called as data and train.'data' folder will be your dataset where the images taken from your webcam will b stored in it. 'train' folder will be used to contain the train.yml file which is made from the data. This train.yml is used to recognize the face.This facial recognition is done by using haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml.

Face and Smile Detection using OpenCV Python:

This python file can be executed in your device directly as it will recognize your face with a blue rectangle and recognize your smile with gree rectangle from the live web cam.
